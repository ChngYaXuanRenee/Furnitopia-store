# FURNITOPIA e-commerce
https://ChngYaXuanRenee.github.io/Furnitopia-store/

It is an e - commerce website of various types of furniture. Our main objective is to provide users with a unique, immersive shopping experience. Making it a distinctive and different purchasing experience from other online stores. We are developing an online store that simulates a 3D in-person purchasing experience. All products have three-dimensional images that customers can examine. This e-commerce will undoubtedly generate a large amount of sales thanks to its originality, interesting experience, and numerous benefits of gamification that are thoughtfully created for users. Retailers use technology to design visually appealing interiors and exteriors for their stores, encouraging customers to appreciate their time spent shopping and in-store. Additionally, it gives merchants a better opportunity to promote their brands and provides co-branding opportunities with suppliers.

-------------------------------------------DESIGN PROCESS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. COLOUR SCHEME - I want the website to have simple colors that reflect the store's corporate identity. The colors used in e-commerce are grey, cyan, and brown. In order for Furnitopia to stand out from the competition and make it clear what it is you give that makes you the better option, as a new customer of the store, I want to find the most appealing e-commerce website that will be simple for me to remember in my mind.

2. PROFESSIONALLY LOOKING - What do we mean by professional? The fonts and color palette. It has logo design and branding slogan and name. All the product links and buttons are workable and funtionable. The website have explanations to describe what Furnitopia will provide by its services and amazing quality. As well as a testimonial site to gain trust from us.
